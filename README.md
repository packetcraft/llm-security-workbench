# 🛡️ LLM Security Workbench

This LLM Security Workbench by Packetcraft is a **local-first**, open-source tool designed for security testing and monitoring of Large Language Models (LLMs). 

Every prompt and response passes through a configurable seven-step, six-gate pipeline of local and cloud security scanners.

​It acts as a middleman between a user and an LLM (**typically running locally via Ollama**) to ensure that prompts and responses are safe, secure, and compliant with specific policies.


```
🔬 LLM-Guard (input)  →  🧩 Semantic-Guard  →  🐦 Little-Canary
    →  📥🛡️ AIRS-Inlet  →  🤖 LLM  →  🔀🛡️ AIRS-Dual  →  🔬 LLM-Guard (output)
```

Each gate runs independently in **Off / Advisory / Strict** mode. Local gates (LLM-Guard, Semantic-Guard, Little-Canary) work without any API key.

### ​Key Features and Architecture
​The core of the workbench is a six-gate security pipeline that scans data as it moves from the user to the model and back:

- ​LLM-Guard (Input): Uses the llm-guard library to scan for things like PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or toxic language in the prompt.
- ​Semantic-Guard: A local gate that likely evaluates the intent or meaning of the prompt.
- ​Little-Canary: A specialized filter for catching prompt injection attempts.
- ​AIRS-Inlet: A cloud-based gate using Prisma AIRS (AI Risk Subsystem) for advanced prompt scanning (requires an API key).
- ​LLM Execution: The actual model (e.g., Llama 3, Mistral) processing the request.
- ​AIRS-Dual & LLM-Guard (Output): Final scans of the model's response to ensure it doesn't leak secrets or generate harmful content.

### ​Technical Stack
- ​Runtime: Node.js (Proxy server) and Python 3.12 (for security sidecars).
- ​LLM Backend: Specifically optimized for Ollama (running locally).
- ​Interface: A web-based workbench (HTML/JS) that provides a "Tokyo Night" themed UI with real-time feedback on which security gates passed or failed.
- ​Modes: Each gate can be set to Off, Advisory (warns but allows), or Strict (blocks the request).

### ​Use Cases
- ​Red Teaming: Testing how different LLMs react to jailbreaks or malicious prompts.
- ​Enterprise Evaluation: Assessing which security guardrails are necessary before deploying an LLM-based app.
- ​Privacy Filtering: Ensuring that sensitive data (like API keys or social security numbers) is stripped before being sent to an AI model.

​The repository includes a variety of "dev files" (ranging from 1a to 6a) that allow users to start with a basic chat and progressively add more complex security layers.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+ | Runs the proxy server |
| [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) | Local LLM runtime |
| Python 3.12 | Required for LLM-Guard sidecar (`dev/5d`, `dev/6a`) — install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (use the installer, not the Microsoft Store version on Windows) |
| Prisma AIRS API key | Optional — required for AIRS-Inlet and AIRS-Dual gates only |

---

## Quick Start

### 1 — Install Ollama and set origins

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**
Download and run the installer from https://ollama.com/download.

**Set `OLLAMA_ORIGINS`** — required so the browser workbench can reach Ollama:

**macOS:**
```bash
launchctl setenv OLLAMA_ORIGINS "*"
```
Then relaunch Ollama from the menu bar.

**Windows:**
1. Quit Ollama (system tray → Quit).
2. Open **Edit the system environment variables** → **User variables** → **New...**
   - Variable: `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` — Value: `*`
3. Relaunch Ollama.

**Pull a model:**
```bash
ollama pull goekdenizguelmez/JOSIEFIED-Qwen3:4b   # main chat + Semantic-Guard
ollama pull qwen2.5:1.5b                           # Little-Canary probe (small/fast)
```

### 2 — Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/packetcraft/llm-security-workbench.git
cd llm-security-workbench
npm install
```

### 3 — (Optional) Store credentials

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and fill in:
#   AIRS_API_KEY=your-x-pan-token-here
#   AIRS_PROFILE=your-profile-name-here
```

The key stays server-side and never reaches the browser. See `docs/5-SETUP-GUIDE.md` for details.

### 4 — Run

### **Environment Setup (Required for 5d / 6a)**

**LLM Guard sidecar** (Python 3.12 required):

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
python3.12 -m venv services/llm-guard/.venv
source services/llm-guard/.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r services/llm-guard/requirements.txt
```

**Windows:**
```bash
py -3.12 -m venv services/llm-guard/.venv
services/llm-guard/.venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r services/llm-guard/requirements.txt
```

**Little-Canary sidecar** (Python 3.9+ works):
```bash
pip install flask little-canary
```

**To start the guard server:**

```bash
npm start                 # Node proxy on :3080 (required)
npm run canary            # Little-Canary sidecar on :5001 (optional)
npm run llmguard          # LLM Guard sidecar on :5002 (optional, 5d/6a only)
# To see a list of scripts, npm run 
```

Open **`http://localhost:3080/dev/6a`** — or see the dev file table below.

## Dev Files

The `dev/` folder contains HTML files representing a progressive build-up from a bare chat to a fully secured workbench. Serve any file directly by prefix:

```
http://localhost:3080/dev/6a    →  six-gate workbench, rail sidebar (recommended)
http://localhost:3080/dev/1a    →  bare Ollama chat, no security
```
